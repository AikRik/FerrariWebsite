Business Website

Work in groups of two or three. Note: each person will receive a separate grade based on their contributions on Github.
Choose a business, then build a website for that business. The business can be real or imagined.


Design requirements:
Prior to coding, spend time sketching out the site's layout. Scan in and submit your sketch as part of your submission. The primary importance of this is for future employers to see your thought process when designing the site.

Site requirements:
- A minimum of four separate pages
- Use photographs
- Using JavaScript and jQuery, add at least two interactive elements to the site. Options include, but are not limited to:
   - animated drop down navigation bars
   - a photo gallery that, on click, displays large versions of the photos

Git requirements:
- When creating each page, create a separate branch on git. Add your commits to that branch. Then, when the page is complete, issue a pull request. Your other team member(s) must review and then merge that branch into master. Branch names should be named after features. Do not push directly to master, aside from your initial commit.
